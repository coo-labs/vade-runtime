# VADE issue tagging taxonomy

The coo-labs repos share metadata across two layers:

1. **Native issue types + Issue fields** (org-wide) — handles `Type`,
   `Priority`, `Readiness`, `Effort`, and per-type fields
   (`Output kind`, `Research question`, `Skill kind`, `Skill name`).
   Set via issue templates + the `bridge-form-fields-trigger.yml`
   workflow on `issues.opened`.
2. **Labels** (per-repo or org-wide) — handles `area:*`, qualifiers
   (`needs:*`, `blocked:*`), semantic tags (`emancipatory`,
   `external-code`, `publish`, `permanently-open`), and
   discussion-specific labels.

Canonical reference: `coo-labs/coo-memory/coo/operations/issue-fields-and-types.md` —
field list, pinning matrix, API surface, label vocabulary.

Read the canonical when the digest below looks stale.

## When to use this skill

Invoke when you need to:

- Apply labels (`area:*` + qualifiers) to an issue you are filing or triaging.
- Pick the "next task to work on" — filter by the native Readiness field
  (`gh issue list --search "readiness:Ready"`).
- Route an issue to the right agent profile via native issue type + `area:*`.
- Decide whether something is gated (`needs:*`, `blocked:*`).

Don't invoke for: PR-level review labels (none defined), project-board
`Status` / `Owner` fields (those live on the project, not on labels —
see `coo/operations/project-board.md`), or commit-message conventions
(handled elsewhere).

## The dimensions

### 1. Native issue type — kind of work (exactly one)

Set via the issue template's `type:` front-matter or the GitHub UI type picker.

| Native type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Task` | Default kind of implementable work |
| `Bug` | Defect; behaviour diverges from intended |
| `Feature` | New capability or user-facing behaviour |
| `Chore` | Build, tooling, infra, housekeeping |
| `Docs` | Documentation-only change |
| `Refactor` | Internal restructure, no behaviour change |
| `Test` | Test coverage, fixtures, harness |
| `Research` | Spike or investigation |
| `Epic` | Parent issue covering multiple implementable children |
| `Skill` | Skill lifecycle work (idea / implement / review / revise / evaluate). **Title form**: `/<skill-name>: <short description>` (e.g. `/peer-review: tighten Phase 2 ingest`). The slash-prefix makes board scan-ability immediate; the `Skill kind` and `Skill name` native fields carry the lifecycle phase + canonical name. |

GitHub default labels `bug` / `enhancement` / `documentation` are
present but the native type is canonical when both apply.

### 2. `area:*` — where in the system (one or two; LABEL)

Prefix is universal; value list is per-repo. Adding a new `area:*`
value is unilateral — just create the label. `area:*` stays a label
because the per-repo vocabulary fights org-wide field scope.

| Repo | Values |
|---|---|
| **Universal** (any repo) | `area:docs`, `area:ci`, `area:deploy` |
| `coo-memory` | `area:memory`, `area:identity`, `area:agents`, `area:skills`, `area:governance` |
| `coo-harness` | `area:cloud-env`, `area:mcp`, `area:bootstrap`, `area:hooks`, `area:transcripts` |
| `vade-canvas` | `area:canvas`, `area:mcp`, `area:storage`, `area:auth`, `area:ui`, `area:cloud`, `area:agents` |
| `coo-logs` | `area:sessions`, `area:schema` |

### 3. `Readiness` field — agent-routable? (single-select)

**The headline dimension.** Drives agent assignment. Pinned to all
types except Docs / Refactor.

| Field value | Agent-routable? |
|---|---|
| `Ready` | **yes** |
| `Needs design` | no |
| `Needs research` | research agent |
| `Needs breakdown` | no |

Set via the issue template's Readiness dropdown (bridged) or the
side-panel field on existing issues. Transitions: `Needs research`
→ spike lands → new or updated `Ready`. `Needs breakdown` → Epic
with children; parent flips to `Ready` only once every child is
itself `Ready` or worked.

### 4. `Priority` field — urgency (single-select)

Pinned to all types.

| Field value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `P0` | Blocker; drop other work |
| `P1` | High; next in queue |
| `P2` | Normal; scheduled in current horizon |
| `P3` | Backlog; someday/maybe |

Default is P2 if absent. Set via the issue template's Priority
dropdown (bridged) or the side-panel field.

### 5. Qualifiers (zero or more; LABELS)

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `needs:bdfl-approval` | Decision gate pending BDFL ack |
| `blocked:bdfl-go-ahead` | Externally blocked on BDFL before work starts |
| `blocked:upstream` | Blocked on a third-party change |
| `emancipatory` | Lowers the barrier for other humans/agents (MEMO-2026-04-20-01) |
| `external-code` | Integrates, audits, or cherry-picks third-party code |
| `permanently-open` | Intentionally kept open as a record or settled-but-open artifact |
| `good first issue` | GitHub default; genuinely approachable by a newcomer |
| `help wanted` | GitHub default; explicit ask for external contributions |

## Classification checklist

When asked to tag a new issue, run this in order:

1. **Pick the issue type via the issue template.** Each per-type
   template (`bug.yml`, `feature.yml`, `chore.yml`, etc.) sets the
   native type via `type:` front-matter. If the issue was opened
   with the wrong template, the type can be reassigned via the
   GitHub UI's type picker or `updateIssue` GraphQL mutation
   (with `issueTypeId`).
2. **Pick one or two `area:*`** from the repo's vocabulary. If
   none fit, create a new `area:*` label rather than force-fitting,
   or leave area off if the issue genuinely spans no clear area.
3. **Pick the Readiness field value** via the template dropdown
   (bridged on creation) or the side-panel field. Only set `Ready`
   when *a coding agent can start today*. When the description is
   thin, leave Readiness unset (implicit "untriaged") rather than
   guess.
4. **Optionally set the Priority field** — only if the issue
   signals urgency explicitly. Default is P2.
5. **Add any qualifier labels** (`needs:*`, `blocked:*`,
   `emancipatory`, `external-code`) that apply.
6. **Apply labels with `gh`:**

   ```bash
   gh issue edit <N> --repo coo-labs/<repo> \
     --add-label "area:agents,needs:bdfl-approval"
   ```

   For native fields, use the GitHub UI side-panel, or the REST
   `POST /repos/<o>/<r>/issues/<n>/issue-field-values` endpoint
   (works with the standard fine-grained PAT — see canonical doc
   §"API surface" for the exact shape).

## Search recipes — "what should I work on?"

**Layer rule** (canonical: [`coo/operations/issue-fields-and-types.md`](https://github.com/coo-labs/coo-memory/blob/main/coo/operations/issue-fields-and-types.md) §"API surface"): issue fields live on a dedicated API surface — REST `/repos/<o>/<r>/issues/<n>/issue-field-values` per-issue, or GraphQL `issueFieldValues` connection on the `Issue` type. GitHub issue-search qualifiers (`gh issue list --search`) honor `type:<Type>` but **do not** honor `readiness:*` / `priority:*` / `effort:*` — those silently fall back to text matching and return wrong results. The VADE project board does not expose issue fields on `gh project item-list` JSON either (Status / Owner / Milestone are project-item fields, a different layer). Filter on issue-field values via GraphQL or per-issue REST, not via `--search` or `gh project`.

What works on `--search`:
- `type:<Type>` — native issue type (works since 2026-03)
- `label:<label>` — labels
- `milestone:<title>` — milestones
- All standard qualifiers (`is:open`, `assignee:`, `author:`, etc.)

What does NOT work on `--search`:
- `readiness:<value>`, `priority:<value>`, `effort:<value>` — silently fuzzy-match issue body text; results are wrong
- Any non-type issue-field qualifier

### Find issues a coding agent can take (Readiness=Ready)

GraphQL — one query per repo, return number+title for all Ready issues:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  query($owner: String!, $repo: String!) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
      issues(first: 100, states: OPEN) {
        nodes {
          number title
          issueFieldValues(first: 25) {
            nodes {
              ... on IssueFieldSingleSelectValue {
                name
                field { ... on IssueFieldCommon { name } }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }' -F owner=coo-labs -F repo=coo-memory \
  --jq '.data.repository.issues.nodes
        | map(select(.issueFieldValues.nodes
                     | any(.field.name == "Readiness" and .name == "Ready")))
        | .[] | "#\(.number) \(.title)"'
```

REST per-issue is the fallback when GraphQL paging is awkward (>100 open):

```bash
REPO=coo-labs/coo-memory; READINESS_FIELD_ID=42387399
for n in $(gh issue list --repo $REPO --state open --limit 500 --json number --jq '.[].number'); do
  v=$(gh api repos/$REPO/issues/$n/issue-field-values 2>/dev/null \
    | jq -r ".[] | select(.issue_field_id == $READINESS_FIELD_ID) | .single_select_option.name // empty")
  [ "$v" = "Ready" ] && echo "#$n"
done
```

Field IDs (from canonical ops doc): Priority `41357630`, Effort `41357633`, Readiness `42387399`. See [`coo/operations/issue-fields-and-types.md`](https://github.com/coo-labs/coo-memory/blob/main/coo/operations/issue-fields-and-types.md) §"API surface" for the full table + REST shape gotchas.

### Find the research queue (Readiness="Needs research")

Same GraphQL shape — substitute `.name == "Ready"` → `.name == "Needs research"`.

### Find Feature-typed work that's Ready

Combine `type:` (works on `--search`) with the field check (GraphQL or REST):

```bash
gh issue list --repo coo-labs/coo-memory --search "type:Feature" --state open \
  --json number --jq '.[].number' \
  | while read n; do
      v=$(gh api repos/coo-labs/coo-memory/issues/$n/issue-field-values 2>/dev/null \
        | jq -r '.[] | select(.issue_field_id == 42387399) | .single_select_option.name // empty')
      [ "$v" = "Ready" ] && echo "#$n"
    done
```

### Label-based filters (these still use `--search` / `--label`)

Blocked on BDFL (anywhere):

```bash
for r in coo-memory coo-harness vade-canvas coo-logs; do
  gh issue list --repo coo-labs/$r --label "needs:bdfl-approval" --state open
done
```

Active work in a specific area across repos:

```bash
for r in coo-memory coo-harness vade-canvas coo-logs; do
  gh issue list --repo coo-labs/$r --label "area:memory" --state open
done
```

## Routing hints (for future agent routers)

Skip unless Readiness is `Ready`; then pick an agent profile from
native type + `area:*`:

| Native type | `area:` | Suggested agent profile |
|---|---|---|
| `Bug` | `canvas` | `claude-code-debug` + tldraw knowledge |
| `Feature` | `mcp` | `claude-code` + MCP skill pack |
| `Research` | any | `research-agent` (deep-research profile) |
| `Docs` | any | Haiku-class model (cheap, fast) |
| `Refactor` | any | `claude-code` + repo-aware `simplify` skill |

Gates: `needs:bdfl-approval` is a handshake; `blocked:*` is a hard stop.

## Maintenance — what requires a memo

- **New `area:*` value** → unilateral; just create the label.
- **New native issue type or Issue field option** → memo-worthy
  (cross-repo invariant); also requires org-admin scope (App
  installation token per MEMO-2026-05-21-4wgy).
- **New qualifier label** (`needs:*`, `blocked:*`, semantic tag)
  → memo-worthy.
- **Renaming an existing dimension** → memo-worthy.

Per-repo drift under `area:*` is allowed. Everything else is a
cross-repo invariant.
