# trace-timeline — interactive bootstrap-trace viewer

Render an interactive swim-lane timeline (Chrome-DevTools-Network-tab
shape) from a bootstrap-trace run. One row per OS process, lifespan
bars, colored event markers for writes / invariant decisions / merges /
script entries, and vertical lines for each snapshot moment colored by
whether `VADE_RUNTIME_DIR` was present in `settings.json` at that
instant. Pan, zoom, click for raw xtrace context.

Companion to the trace capture harness — see
[`scripts/debug/README.md`](../../scripts/debug/README.md) for the
capture side (`BASH_ENV` + `VADE_BOOTSTRAP_TRACE_MODE=1`).

## When to use this skill

Invoke when the user wants to **look** at a bootstrap trace rather
than read it. Triggers:

- "show me / visualize / render the trace"
- "interactive diagram of the boot"
- "timeline of the / what happened during the / when did X fire"
- "view the race", "see the writes", "see the snapshots"
- The user names a trace directory under `~/.vade/traces/`
  and would benefit from a chart over raw `xtrace.log` lines.

Don't invoke for:

- Running a fresh capture (handled by `bootstrap-trace-init.sh` and the
  container UI env vars per `scripts/debug/README.md`).
- Proposing fixes to the boot pipeline (the
  [coo-labs/vade-coo-memory#762](https://github.com/coo-labs/vade-coo-memory/issues/762)
  pause forbids it — render-and-document only).
- Traces produced by tools other than the bootstrap-trace harness
  (file layout is specific to this harness).

## Procedure

### 1. Locate the trace

If the user named one, use that. Otherwise default to the current:

```sh
TRACE=~/.vade/traces/$(cat ~/.vade/traces/CURRENT_RUN_ID)
ls "$TRACE" && cat "$TRACE/meta.json"
```

If `CURRENT_RUN_ID` is missing or `xtrace.log` doesn't exist, stop and
report — the harness either hasn't run or its output rolled.

### 2. Render

```sh
python3 /home/user/vade-runtime/scripts/debug/render-trace-timeline.py "$TRACE" /tmp/trace-timeline.html
```

The script:

- Parses `xtrace.log` (PS4-prefixed, one bash command per line) into
  per-PID lifespans and event lists. Also captures a per-PID
  **command log** (up to ~80 commands per script, excluding noise
  scripts like `git`, `dispatch.sh`, guards) so the detail panel
  can show what each script actually did, line by line.
- Resolves each PID to its real script name using the
  `_VTRACE_INVOCATION_TAG=` line emitted by `bootstrap-trace-init.sh`
  (first-seen wins — long-lived processes that re-source the init for
  a subshell don't get retagged).
- Walks `snapshots/*/content/settings.json` for each capture and
  records whether `VADE_RUNTIME_DIR` / `VADE_COO_MEMORY_DIR` /
  `VADE_CLOUD_STATE_DIR` were present.
- Scans `snapshots/*/metadata/processes.txt` for **PID → PPID
  relationships** so the renderer can build a process tree (parent
  chain + tracked children) per PID. Prefers `ps`-side identity over
  xtrace identity when walking the ancestor chain (handles PID reuse
  cleanly).
- Captures these event kinds (one marker each on the timeline):
    - `_write_claude_settings_*` — file writes (orange)
    - `merge_coo_settings_*` — wrapper merge calls (blue)
    - `_add D[0-9]+ (true|false|skip)` — D-group invariant decisions
      (green / red / gray)
    - `set -euo pipefail` from a user script — script entry (purple)
    - selected `[vade-setup] …` log lines (gray notes)
- Writes a single self-contained HTML file (~3–4 MB; size scales with
  command-log volume and process count) with embedded JSON. No CDN
  dependencies; opens offline.

### 3. Deliver

```sh
SendUserFile /tmp/trace-timeline.html with a one-line caption.
```

Orient the user briefly:

- **Default view** is the boot window (0–22 s), noise wrappers
  (`dispatch.sh`, guards, brief `git` subprocesses) hidden.
- **"boot (0–5 s)"** button zooms onto the actual race.
- **Desktop**: Ctrl/⌘ + scroll zooms; drag the time slider for fine
  control; the script-name filter input narrows rows.
- **iPad / touch**: two-finger pinch zooms the timeline; drag pans;
  tap an event/snapshot to open the detail sheet from the right. Top
  -right floating buttons handle WebView quirks — `⇕` hides the
  header+legend to claim ~70 px of vertical, `▼` / `▲` nudge the top
  padding in 20 px steps for apps whose toolbar overlays the page
  (Files-app viewer etc). All settings persist via localStorage.
- **Right sidebar** is resizable: drag its left edge (cursor turns
  to ↔; hairline highlights yellow). Width persists.
- **View mode toggle** in the controls bar: `rows` (default —
  ordered by start time) and `tree` (preorder by parent→child, with
  SVG L-shaped connectors drawn from each parent's bar down/up to
  the child's start position, plus depth indent on labels).
- Snapshot dots above the timeline are **red** when
  `VADE_RUNTIME_DIR` is missing from `settings.json`, **green** when
  present.
- Click any event marker, snapshot dot, or process span for raw
  xtrace context in the right-hand detail panel. The process detail
  shows the **full ancestor chain** (each tracked ancestor click-to-
  jumps), **traced children**, and an expandable **command log** of
  what the script actually executed.

If the trace contains a D4=false event (the canonical reader-vs-writer
race for coo-labs/vade-coo-memory#762), name it explicitly — the bright
red glowing dot in the integrity-check row, with the three orange
write markers in the session-start-sync row immediately around it,
**is** the race.

## What the timeline answers

| Question | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Which hooks ran in parallel? | Stacked lifespan bars in the default view. |
| Did writer A and writer B overlap? | Two rows, their orange markers' x-positions. |
| Did integrity-check read before settings.json was complete? | Red snapshot dots to the left of the writer's last orange marker; D4=false event between them. |
| Why did D-group invariant N fail? | Click the red marker on the integrity-check row → detail panel shows `_add` source line, full `cmd` text, and `detail` string. |
| When did each script enter? | Purple "enter" markers at the left edge of each row's lifespan bar. |
| Which subprocess of integrity-check is which `git`? | Toggle off "hide wrappers" and the brief git PIDs appear; click each for its commands count and PID. |
| What launched X? What did X spawn? | Click X's lifespan bar → detail panel's **ancestor chain** walks PID→PPID up to PID 1 (each tracked link clickable to jump). **Children** lists tracked subprocesses. Or flip the view-mode toggle to **tree** to see all of it visually with SVG connectors. |
| What did X actually do? | Click X's lifespan bar → detail panel's **command log** shows up to ~80 bash commands the script ran (timestamp · script:line · function · raw bash). Suppressed for noise scripts to keep file size manageable. |

## What the timeline can't answer

- **Sub-millisecond interleave inside `node -e` blocks.** xtrace records
  bash entry/exit, not syscalls inside spawned binaries. Atomic-rename
  vs read inside a node helper is invisible at this resolution.
- **Anything before the first traced bash invocation.** Anthropic's
  pre-clone phase happens before `BASH_ENV` resolves; the trace begins
  at the first bash after the repo is on disk.
- **All children, including non-bash subprocesses.** The "children"
  list in the detail panel and the connectors in tree-view only show
  PIDs that appear in our xtrace (i.e. bash subprocesses that
  re-sourced `bootstrap-trace-init.sh`). Short-lived non-bash forks
  like `cp` / `chmod` aren't traced. The `ps cmd` shown on each
  ancestor row gives the launching context where xtrace silent.

## Re-running on a fresh trace

The renderer is parameterized. Point it at any `~/.vade/traces/<run-id>/`
directory — pass the path positionally:

```sh
python3 /home/user/vade-runtime/scripts/debug/render-trace-timeline.py \
    ~/.vade/traces/bootstrap-trace-XXXX-YYYY \
    /tmp/trace-timeline.html
```

No arguments → defaults to the run named in `~/.vade/traces/CURRENT_RUN_ID`,
output to `/tmp/trace-timeline.html`.
